My computer science NEA project. It is a 2D top down shooter

Features:
  Inputing with both Keyboard and mouse, and Gamepad
  Shop to buy guns and upgrades to stats
  Simplistic level system that has no use right now
  Majority of assets taken from online or half assed on Piskel

This is a work in progress, so things might be a bit rough
Some mechanics could change as I tweak things
Might add more features if I feel like it
