This is my A level OCR Computer Science NEA project — a 2D top-down shooter with a focus on player interaction, upgrades, and basic gameplay mechanics. It’s still a work in progress.

Features:
  Inputing with both Keyboard and mouse, and Gamepad
  Shop to buy guns and upgrades to stats
  Simplistic level system that has no use right now
  Majority of assets taken from online or half assed on Piskel

This is a work in progress, so things might be a bit rough
Some mechanics could change as I tweak things
Might add more features if I feel like it

Planned Features:
Level progression: More interesting levels with enemies, challenges, and a progression system.
AI enemies: Better enemy logic to make the game more challenging.
More upgrades: I’m planning on adding more ways to customize your character’s stats.

I used Chat GPT for ts README
